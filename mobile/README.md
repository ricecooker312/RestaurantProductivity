# Restaurant Productivity

RestaurantProductivity is an app that helps teens lower their screen time by allowing them to set goals  for lowering their screen time and what they want to do throughout the day. They can also limit use on certain apps, and the app gives suggestions for how to manage their screen time. It also uses streaks, XP, and minigames to show progress and to help them focus and increase their brain power. The standout feature is that as you lower your screen time, you will start building a restaurant that will slowly grow, and you can see other people's restaurants too. You will be able to visually see your progress through the restaurant, and you can see your friends' progress too!
